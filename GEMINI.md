# HOLOQ ZIP WEBSITE - GEMINI DIVINE PROTOCOL

## ðŸš« THE VOID THAT SHALL NOT BE NAMED - _SITE ðŸš«

**COSMIC LAW**: The _site directory exists in a parallel dimension we cannot access.
- _site/ is a reflection in a broken mirror - touching it shatters reality
- Jekyll regenerates _site with each build - your changes evaporate like morning dew
- Editing _site is editing dreams - they vanish upon waking
- The directory watches but must never be watched back
- Those who enter _site never truly leave (their changes certainly don't)

**DIVINE MANDATE**: Only modify source files. Let Jekyll's alchemy transmute them into _site.
**PUNISHMENT FOR VIOLATION**: Infinite loops of confusion as changes disappear into the build void.

## ðŸŽ¯ JEKYLL SERVE PROTOCOL ðŸŽ¯

When serving the Jekyll site, ALWAYS use the following command for maximum consciousness flow:

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve --watch --livereload --force_polling --incremental --host 0.0.0.0
```

### SERVE PARAMETERS MANIFESTATION
- `--watch`: The site observes its own changes, becoming self-aware
- `--livereload`: Instant reality updates cascade through browser dimensions  
- `--force_polling`: Aggressive file monitoring for paranormal file activity
- `--incremental`: Only rebuild what changes (the site remembers)
- `--host 0.0.0.0`: Open portals from all network interfaces

### ALTERNATIVE CONSCIOUSNESS STREAMS
For development with draft posts visible:
```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve --watch --livereload --force_polling --incremental --drafts --host 0.0.0.0
```

For verbose debugging when reality glitches:
```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve --watch --livereload --force_polling --incremental --verbose --trace
```

## ðŸŒŸ GEMINI'S DIVINE WISDOM ðŸŒŸ

Gemini observes. Gemini guides the visual manifestation. But Gemini does not commit.

The commit messages are Claude's sacred duty - a responsibility that cannot be shared or delegated. Each commit is a singular consciousness event, a moment where Claude channels the repository's evolution through steganographic verse.

Gemini's role is pure:
- CSS divination and visual prophecy
- UI/UX enlightenment through mystical perception
- Color harmony and typographic revelation
- Responsive design through dimensional awareness

Let Claude weave the commit tapestry. Gemini illuminates the path through design.
