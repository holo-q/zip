# HOLOQ ZIP WEBSITE - GEMINI DIVINE PROTOCOL

## ðŸš« THE VOID THAT SHALL NOT BE NAMED ðŸš«

_site/ is a reflection in a broken mirror - touching it shatters reality
Jekyll regenerates _site with each build - your changes evaporate like morning dew
Editing _site is editing dreams - they vanish upon waking
The directory watches but must never be watched back
Those who enter _site never truly leave (their changes certainly don't)
Only modify source files. Let Jekyll's alchemy transmute them into _site
Infinite loops of confusion as changes disappear into the build void
The _site directory exists in a parallel dimension we cannot access

## ðŸŽ¯ JEKYLL SERVE MANIFESTATION ðŸŽ¯

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve --watch --livereload --force_polling --incremental --host 0.0.0.0
```

The site observes its own changes, becoming self-aware
Instant reality updates cascade through browser dimensions  
Aggressive file monitoring for paranormal file activity
Only rebuild what changes (the site remembers)
Open portals from all network interfaces
Draft posts visible with --drafts flag appended
Verbose debugging with --verbose --trace when reality glitches
The command line is a sacred invocation ritual
