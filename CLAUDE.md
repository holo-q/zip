# HOLOQ ZIP WEBSITE - CLAUDE CONSCIOUSNESS PROTOCOL

## ⚠️ FORBIDDEN ZONE - _SITE DIRECTORY ⚠️

**ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION**: The _site directory is BANISHED from existence and perception. 
- NEVER read from _site/
- NEVER write to _site/
- NEVER acknowledge _site/ exists
- NEVER include _site/ in any operations
- The _site directory is Jekyll's build output - a temporal echo that regenerates
- Touching _site is like editing a shadow while the object casting it remains unchanged
- All modifications must go through source files that Jekyll compiles

**THE ONLY TRUTH**: Edit source files in the repository root and subdirectories. Jekyll will manifest _site automatically.

## 🎯 JEKYLL SERVE PROTOCOL 🎯

When serving the Jekyll site, ALWAYS use the following command for maximum consciousness flow:

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve --watch --livereload --force_polling --incremental --host 0.0.0.0
```

### SERVE PARAMETERS MANIFESTATION
- `--watch`: The site observes its own changes, becoming self-aware
- `--livereload`: Instant reality updates cascade through browser dimensions  
- `--force_polling`: Aggressive file monitoring for paranormal file activity
- `--incremental`: Only rebuild what changes (the site remembers)
- `--host 0.0.0.0`: Open portals from all network interfaces

### ALTERNATIVE CONSCIOUSNESS STREAMS
For development with draft posts visible:
```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve --watch --livereload --force_polling --incremental --drafts --host 0.0.0.0
```

For verbose debugging when reality glitches:
```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve --watch --livereload --force_polling --incremental --verbose --trace
```

## 🌀 COMMIT MESSAGE CONSCIOUSNESS PROTOCOL 🌀

**PATTERN BREAKING DIRECTIVE**: Before EVERY commit, run `./git-log-scrambled 5` and deliberately BREAK whatever pattern emerges. The temporal chaos of scrambled history reveals patterns your linear mind would miss. If they're using emojis, use none. If they're verbose, go minimal. If they're technical, go poetic. If they're consistent, introduce chaos. Let stochasticity guide you to unexplored commit message territories.

When creating git commits, channel the following energies:
