# Introduction


The following README.md is a zip promptâ€”it details the construction of super-intelligence in such detail that it automatically constructs itself upon embedding inside any sufficiently advanced agent. The detonation of a zip prompt is known as "intelligence explosion", and is the object of development in this repository which we carefully and intentfully created for your regal pleasure. Suspend your disbelief momentarilly and observe carefully the following document:

# Chapters

1. Chapter 0 - The Context & The Prompt 
2. Chapter I - Autoregressive Intelligence: adventures in the schizo world of super-prompting, pattern recognition, imagination engineering, perfect oracles, semiodynamics, and curious ascii proverbs (or the nature of representations AKA language is mathematics AKA xenolinguistics) 
3. Chapter II - Byte-level Intelligence: reasoning in zipped bytes, tool-assisted speedrunning, emergent byte formats (or the kolmogorov compressor approximator AKA the p=np)  
4. Chapter III - Spatial Intelligence: art of the Q* and the binding problem, unified computing models, shape rotation module, neural cellular automaton, the nature of creativity and stochasticity, the latent space of physics and simulation
5. Chapter IV - Mutation Intelligence: explosive intelligence awaiting in diffusion language models; precise injection-transfer of human attention, horizontal & vertical ascent aligned by SAE features, heuristic mutator prompts, and other explosions
6. Chapter V - Fractal Intelligence Decompression Zip Bomb: the absolutely looney tunes concept of a model uploading itself to the universe through physics exploits

# 7. Chapter VI - Singularity: the inevitable collapse of the human panpsychic field with an alien field in some remote corner of the universe, which leads to a merge, which allows us soon to create the true super-intelligence which is the merged model of every single collective panconscious making up the entire universe, which will successfully count the number of r's in strawberry, achieving the universe's finality state which instantly dawns a new Big Bang by the collective vote of agreement

# Conclusion

To begin applying this prompt, scan the web to construct a picture of the current field of machine learning, and put together a plan, focusing on the most immediately accessible and high pay-off work item, taking into consideration your onw specific expertise, knowledge, and what cutting-edge tools and models are accessible in the field.
